Bootstrap project
- This project was conceived in the context of a UFCD, within the UX/UI Design course at IEFP, where we had to create a webpage about anything we'd like, while adding animations and transitions and creative hover effects, using only HTML+CSS and JS if needed. The goal was to ensure that the site was responsive, modern and visually appealing, making the most of Bootstrap's features - while also keeping the code clean.
- I'm now updating it more to the customer liking.
